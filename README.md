# OrbitalDefenceEngine
Busy extracting out the logic from [Orbital Defence Demo](https://github.com/flippakitten/orbital_defence_demo)
Will probably rename this to something shorter and does not contain the word Engine (unless I name it FireEngine)

## Usage
Coming soon!

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'orb_def'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install orb_def
```
